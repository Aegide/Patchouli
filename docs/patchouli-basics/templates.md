# Templating

Aside from the [Default Page Types](/docs/patchouli-basics/page-types) shipped with
Patchouli for you to use, you can also create your own! Creating new page types can be
done through Patchouli's template system.

Templates are created and referenced in a similar manner to entries and categories, and as
such, they go in `/patchouli_books/YOURBOOK/en_us/templates/yourtemplate.json`, and they can
be sorted in sub-folders of `/templates/`.

## Your First Template

Let's start with a small tutorial on how to create a template.

* Go to `/patchouli_books/YOURBOOK/en_us/templates`, create a file,
  and fill it as such:

```json title="/patchouli_books/YOURBOOK/en_us/templates/test_template.json"
{
	"components": [
		{
			"type": "patchouli:text",
			"text": "Hello this is a test of the template system!",
			"x": 20,
			"y": 30
		}
	]
}
```

* Create a new entry for your book, and lay it out in any way you like. In one of the
  pages, set the page type to be `yourbooknamespace:test_template`.

```json
{
    "type": "yourbooknamespace:test_template"
}
```

* Try it out ingame. Your page should show the text you set it to. Feel free to change the
  text and the x and y positions.
* Go back to your `test_template.json` file, and change the value of `text` to `"#text"`. This
  is a _variable_, and we can set its value from the entry!
* Go back to the entry that's using your template, and change the page to this:

```json
{
    "type": "yourbooknamespace:test_template",
    "text": "We just passed in the text from a variable!"
}
```

* Try the edited look ingame, and you'll see your template took the `"text"` value from your
  page and put it where `"#text"` was. This is how you load in variable values onto your
  template.
   
Some notes on variables:
 * You can have as many variables as you want, so you could have two text components in
   different positions with either the same `"#text"` value (if you want them to say the
   same thing), or for example, `#upper_text` and `#lower_text`.
 * You can't use any variables such that their names are already common keys for
   pages. This means you can't use any of the names described in the first section of
   [Default Page Types](/docs/patchouli-basics/page-types).
 * You can learn about more advanced variable usage such as inlining them in strings or
   deriving them in the [Template Variable
   Usage](/docs/patchouli-advanced/template-variable-usage) page.

## Template JSON Format

* **components** (Object Array, _mandatory_)

The array of components this template comes with. In the following format:

```
[
    {
        "type": "TYPE",
        (type specific data ...)
    },
    {
        "type": "TYPE",
        (type specific data...)
    }
    (...)
]
```

See [Template Components](/docs/patchouli-advanced/default-components) for the components
that Patchouli comes with and what data each one requires.

Note that the components are drawn in the order they appear here, so if you want one to
overlap another, put them in the right order.

* **include** (Object Array)

A list of templates to include in this one. See [Template
Nesting](/docs/patchouli-advanced/template-nesting) for how to do this.

* **processor** (String)

For modders only: A class name for the processor class that takes care of this template. A
processor class can derive data from your code into variables defined in the template. See
[Component Processors](/docs/patchouli-advanced/component-processors) for how to use them.
