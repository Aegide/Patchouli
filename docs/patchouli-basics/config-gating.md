# Gating Content with Config Flags

Config Flags are a system that allows content in the book to be dynamically hot swapped
based on configuration and the game environment. In a few places across the book json
structures, you'll find "flag" tags, which can be filled with a config flag expression.

Flags are boolean values (true or false), and expressions can be a few flags connected to
create a statement based on multiple flags. More often than not, you won't need to write
an expression, and can just write the flag itself. Should you write the name of a flag
that's not defined, it defaults to false.

Any content (all the way from category, entry, page, or even template component) will be
disabled if it has a flag expression assigned to it, and said expression happens to
evaluate to false.

## Default Flags

* **debug**: Is true when the game is being loaded from an IDE Debug mode
* **advancements_disabled**: Is true when the "Disable Advancement Locking" option in the
  Patchouli config is true
* **testing_mode**: Is true when the "Testing Mode" option in the Patchouli config is true
* **mod:MODID**: Is true when the mod MODID is loaded in the game. (e.g. "mod:quark" would
  be true if Quark is loaded)

## Flag Expressions

* `!flag`: Is true when flag is false (negation)
* `&flag1,flag2,flag3...`: Is true when flag1, flag2, flag3... are all true (conjuction)
* `|flag2,flag2,flag3...`: Is true when at least one of flag1, flag2, flag3... is true
  (disjunction)

## Adding your own Flags

This system is intended for modders more so than mod pack makers, as it allows them to
dynamically change the book based on their own config needs. This can be accomplished
through hooks in the [Patchouli
API](https://github.com/Vazkii/Patchouli/tree/master/src/main/java/vazkii/patchouli/api).
